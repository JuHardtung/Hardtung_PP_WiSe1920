\label{planning}

The focus should be to implement the very basics of origami diagramming first. These include the different types of lines (\ref{sec:folds}), the various arrows (\ref{sec:arrows}) and ?????????????????. This decision was made, because the more complex procedures like sinks, pleats/crimps, reverse folds and rabbit ears can mostly be explained and visually shown with only the few basic symbols.
When the basic functions are finished, new features can be implemented that will allow the user to create diagrams even more efficiently.
