\section{Prospect and further possible Features}
\label{sec:prospect}

Despite the mostly finished state of \gls{origrammer} there are various additional features that could prove useful once implemented. This section will list and explain missing features and general usability improvements and the following subsections are roughly sorted by descending importance. Though this should not be seen as an extensive list of missing essential features, but rather as a prospect on what the further development of this diagramming program could look like. 

\subsection{Export to .pdf}

Exporting a finished diagram to the Portable Document Format (PDF) would provide an easy way to share diagrams created within the Origrammer. This would provide greater accessibility to the diagrams while also removing the requirement of using the Origrammer just for displaying purposes. This would be especially helpful for folders who simply want to follow the diagrams.

\subsection{TBD}
