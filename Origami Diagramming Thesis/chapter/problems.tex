\section{Problems \& other findings}
\label{sec:problems}

This section discusses decisions made and problems that arose during the development process.


Rendering the lines of the paper, all the arrows and other symbols could be done in a plethora of ways. Although using graphics libraries like JavaFx, libgdx, lwjgl or jogl were some of the options, the Origrammer relies only on Graphics2D. The more sophisticated graphics libraries were mostly developed for game development and offer a lot of features that were not necessary for this project.


quality problems while scaling the notation symbols --> solution: using .svg instead of .png

rotating ImageIcons

JFrame --> JPanel --> JLabel --> ImageIcon --> BufferedImage --> Arrow

Can move, scale but not rotate (either override the paintComponent method) or use graphics2d.rotate();)
Both doesn't work for my setup

dirty solution--> load different, already rotated images depending on OriArrow rotation.




calculations are sometimes breaking depending on user input
|
--> for example OriEqualAnglSymbol: 	firstV	--> point of angle
						scndV	--> verticalVertex			if verticalVertex and horizontalVertex are switched, everything breaks
						thirdV --> horizontalVertex
